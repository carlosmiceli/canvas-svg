## Description

This an idea for a project where I could test my front-end skills a bit further, and play around with new libraries like Konva. There are no plans to develop it further. It was also a fun excuse to learn to use Next.js and Vercel.

## Status

Project is finished, feel free to visit the website and test it out.
Main goal was to expand my portfolio and push myself to code/learn new stuff.
App is hosted on Vercel: https://canvas-svg.vercel.app/

## Technologies

Project is created with:

* Javascript - 1.7 in Chrome
* React - 17.0.2
* Next - 11.0.1
* Material UI - 4.11.4
* Konva - 8.1.1
* React Konva - 17.0.2-4
* Multiple libraries (e.g.: Axios, Svgson, etc.)
