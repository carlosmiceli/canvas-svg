# Canvas Challenge for Carlos Miceli

### Day 1

- I figured the first thing I needed to do was to read carefully and digest the Challenge instructions and new tech/tools/code I needed to get familiar with, which turned into this list:
    - SVG code
    - Drag, Drop, Rotate, Resize, change Colors, etc.
    - LocalStorage (used it before but will need to refresh my memory)
        - If I'm not mistaken, I can persist the SVG's values with LocalStorage only, and wouldn't need to use Redux, although I'll revisit this hypothesis later.
    - Create two pages: Login + Canvas
    - Download file
    - Next.js
    - React Konva
    - Tailwind
    - Vercel
    - Markdown

- After that, I made a sequence of steps that I imagined I'd go through:
    - Outline tech and milestones (step above).
    - Watch/read about the most important elements to start (Next.js, Markdown, etc.). Ended up choosing a Fireship tutorial that I'm following while I start building the Canvas.
    - Start project with NextJS boilerplate.
    - Create repo, Markdown log, and host boilerplate in Vercel to quickly test the tool.
    - Breakdown challenge into smaller goals that I can accomplish each day.

- Created and published NextJS boilerplate in Vercel here: https://canvas-svg.vercel.app/
- Played around a bit to understand NextJS' api and pages(routes) functionality.
